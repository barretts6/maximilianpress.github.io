<p>Hi, my name is max. Welcome to my brutalist website.</p> 

<p>I currently work as a bioinformatician for Phase Genomics Inc., where I work on methods for finding whole microbial genomes out of mixed samples.</p>

<p>My CV is <a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress/PRESS_CV/blob/master/Press_CV_late2016.pdf">here</a>.</pr>

<p>If you are masochistic, you can read my dissertation <a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress/gs_thesis/blob/master/observations-effects-epistasis/main.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to read papers I've published, try <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o76x5xQAAAAJ">google scholar</a>.</p>

<p>I sometimes <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process">embarrass myself in public</a>. On that note, I occasionally express ill-considered opinions on miscellaneous topics <a href="https://medium.com/@iusewords/">on medium</a>.</p>

<p>I maintain a <a href="https://twitter.com/EurovizhnWisdom">silly twitterbot</a>.</p>

<p>I sort of have social media accounts but I wouldn't recommend looking at them.</p>
